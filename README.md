# meowllo-nyan-cat

Meowllo! Bringing Nyan Cat back better than ever as a Docker/Kube test. Oh hai!

# Usage

Originally built in Ubuntu 18.04.2LTS

Simple nodeJS code for a quick functionality test in Docker/Kubernetes. Not intended for business use for any reason unless you just want to curl port 3000 all day for super happy oh hai responses.

# How To

Feel free to clone for manual usage or docker pull h0lmstr0m/meowllo-nyan-cat for Docker testing.
To test: simply pull the image -> run locally with port map 3000:3000 -> open new SSH session to localhost -> run curl localhost:3000

Bask in the glory of Nyan Cat!
